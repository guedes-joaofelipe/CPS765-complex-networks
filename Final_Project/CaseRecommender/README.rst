Case Recommender - A Python Framework for RecSys
===================================================

Case Recommender is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and
explicit feedback.  The framework aims to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized
recommender system from a set of algorithms. Case Recommender has different types of item recommendation and rating
prediction approaches, and different metrics validation and evaluation.

Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Item Recommendation:

- BPRMF

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Group-based (Clustering-based algorithm)

- Paco Recommender (Co-Clustering-based algorithm)

- Most Popular

- Random

- Content Based

Rating Prediction:

- Matrix Factorization (with and without baseline)

- SVD

- Non-negative Matrix Factorization

- SVD++

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Item NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- User NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- Most Popular

- Random

- gSVD++

- Item-MSMF

- (E)CoRec

Clustering:

- PaCo: EntroPy Anomalies in Co-Clustering

- k-medoids

Evaluation and Validation Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- All-but-one Protocol

- Cross-fold- Validation

- Item Recommendation: Precision, Recall, NDCG and Map

- Rating Prediction: MAE and RMSE

- Statistical Analysis (T-test and Wilcoxon)

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python >= 3
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
